TODO
----

* add ability to an arbitrary list of facets to IdeaModule which will synthesize correct
  <component> section.

* Add the ability to add in arbitrary modules to .ipr file 

* add a task that downloads the corresponding source deps for any jar dependency. If present
  set them sources dependency into the SOURCES section of module dependency. Do the same for
  javadocs.

* Determine whether the library is packaged as a gem and if so run tests using buildr gem.
  See http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/rubygems-update/Gem.html#M000228

* Support :base_dir when defining projects ala define('subproject', :base_dir => 'boo')

* Make the compile dependencies exported and the test dependencies not exported.
  Currently all dependencies are exported.

* If project includes Scala code then add a Scala facet manager.

* If project generates a war package then generate web facet.

* Fix dependencies through no_iml projects. Useful for wrap OSGi bundles that
  have no dir and thus we probably should not create the module file.

* Add the ability for the module and project files to be generated off into a
  different directory hierarchy. i.e. Generate project modules into .idea_project
  in base directory

* Generate component elements for "ProjectRootManager", "JavacSettings" and
  "CompilerConfiguration" based on compiler.options in the project file. Allow
  the user to override as appropriate
