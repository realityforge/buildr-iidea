* Changed: The documentation indicated that the iml.local_repository_env_override value

  Use $MAVEN_REPOSITORY$ to match the behaviour of IDEA 9.x.
* Added: Dependencies that are not in the maven repository or in projects where
  iml.local_repository_env_override is set nil will now have paths relative to the
  module directory.
* Added: Ability to disable generation of content section using iml.skip_content!
* Fixed: A project which is tagged with no_iml may have a child with an IML.
* Changed: Directories that are outside content dir are no longer excluded in the content
  section.
