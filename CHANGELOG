  defaulted to nil while the code defaulted the value to M2_REPO. The code was changed to
  Use $MAVEN_REPOSITORY$ to match the behaviour of IDEA 9.x.

  iml.local_repository_env_override is set nil will now have paths relative to the
  module directory.

* Fixed: A project which is tagged with no_iml may have a child with an IML.
